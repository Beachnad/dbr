# dbr

dbr (Danny Beachnau R) is my R package that contains miscellaneous ggplot themes and helper functions. I was tired of copying my code from project-to-project so I built an R package instead.

# Contents

Three main components:

- ggplot themes
- helper functions
  - currently just a mode function
- color vectors
